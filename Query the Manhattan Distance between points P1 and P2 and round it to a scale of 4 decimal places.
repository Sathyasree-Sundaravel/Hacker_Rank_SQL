-- Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

-- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
-- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
-- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
-- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

-- Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

select round(abs(min(lat_n)-max(lat_n))+abs(min(long_w)-max(long_w)),4) from station;
